# Shared Memory Project

## Overview
The **Shared Memory Project** is an open-source tool designed to facilitate the easy sharing of information. Inspired by real-life challenges in remembering and organizing information (like beer preferences and sharing them with friends), this project aims to act as a "shared memory" system with mobile support for convenience.

This project is being developed as a showcase of skills and as a practical tool for personal use. It also serves as a way to enjoy the development process while leveraging the power of AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.8.1+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/TOlchawa/yapp
   ```

Run `scripts/setup-maven.sh` to install Maven if needed.

### Camera Preview
The web camera works only over HTTPS or on `localhost`.
Give the browser permission to use the camera.

### Code Formatting

## Deployment with GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions to deploy the backend and frontend.

Workflows:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` runs after the *Integration Tests* workflow.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-on-merge.yml` runs when a pull request is merged into `main`.
- `.github/workflows/restart-services.yml` runs whenever code is pushed to `main`.

All workflows expect an environment called `PROD`. To configure it:

1. In your repository, open **Settings â†’ Environments** and create `PROD`.
2. In `PROD` add these *secrets*:
   - `SSH_USER`
   - `SSH_PASSWORD`
   - `SSH_HOST`
3. Add these *variables*:
   - `SERVER_HOME`
   - `FRONTEND_HOME`
   - `SERVER_SCRIPT`
   - `FRONTEND_SCRIPT`

`restart-services.yml` reads these values and passes them to `scripts/restart-services.sh` to restart the services on your server whenever `main` is updated.
