This project was created to showcase my skills when applying for jobs and because I genuinely need this functionality. Instead of finding a ready-made solution, I prefer to build it myself for the joy, satisfaction, and practical experience.

I’m using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to speed up development. The idea was inspired by challenges in remembering and sharing beer-related information with friends, leading to a tool for easy information sharing with mobile support.

AI simplifies small projects, but motivation remains key. That’s why I’m making it open-source—not for profit, but to encourage collaboration. Plus, open-source participation grants access to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, which enhances my "pet projects."

This manifesto is a reminder of why I’m doing this: for learning, enjoyment, and creating something meaningful that reflects my passions and needs.

Additionally, since I currently use different technologies at work, I am doing this project to stay proficient in Spring Boot and Java projects.
