    <h1>Shared Memory Project</h1>
    <p>
        This project was created to showcase skills and solve a real-world problem I encountered. Instead of looking for existing solutions, I decided to build it myself for the joy of learning, creating, and achieving practical experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea originated from challenges in remembering and sharing specific information—initially about beers—with friends and family. The project aims to simplify information sharing by acting as a "shared memory" system with mobile support for ease of use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leveraging the power of AI, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, I’m working to bring this idea to life. The project is open-source, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing while staying true to its non-commercial roots.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether this project remains a personal tool or evolves into a collaborative effort, its purpose remains the same: to build something meaningful, useful, and reflective of my values.
